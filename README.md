# Analysis of the Underreported Antimicrobial Gene - *blaSCO-1*

This repository contains the data, scripts, and analysis results for the manuscript:

### **The Global Spread and Clinical Relevance of the Underreported *blaSCO-1* Resistance Gene**



## Description

This project analyzes the temporal, host, and geographic distribution of the **blaSCO-1** β-lactamase gene using metadata from the NCBI Pathogen Detection Database. 

- The goal is to evaluate the clinical relevance and emergence patterns of *blaSCO-1* across bacterial species

> **Note:** Many isolates analyzed in this project have not been described in the literature. This analysis offers a first look into the global and cross-host spread of blaSCO-1 based on public metadata.



## Research Questions

- What is the global distribution of the *blaSCO-1* gene across bacterial species and hosts?
- How does its temporal distribution inform its clinical relevance?
- What host–species combinations are associated with earlier or more recent detection?



## Dataset Overview

- **Source:** [NCBI Pathogen Detection → MicroBIGG-E](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/microbigge/) using the keyword `"blasco-1"`
- **Date Accessed:** 2024-04-08

### Metadata Fields:
- Scientific name  
- Host  
- Geographic origin  
- Isolation source & type  
- Collection date  
- Strand orientation  
- Method of detection  
- Element name: *blaSCO-1*

This metadata was downloaded in CSV format.

## Reproducing the Analysis

To run the full analysis, open `Blasco-1-Analysis.Rmd` in **RStudio** and knit it to **HTML**.


## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone <https://github.com/NVI0001/blasco-1-analysis>`
   

2. Dependencies

The analysis relies on several R packages. Make sure they are installed before running the code. You can install them using the command below:

```
install.packages(c(
  "stringr",      # String manipulation
  "dplyr",        # Data wrangling
  "tidyverse",    # Collection of core tidy data tools
  "ggplot2",      # Plotting system
  "forcats",      # Factor manipulation
  "maps",         # Map data (e.g., world outlines)
  "lme4",         # Mixed-effects models
  "ggpubr",       # Publication-ready visualizations
  "ggrepel",      # Non-overlapping text labels in ggplot
  "emmeans",      # Estimated marginal means
  "fs",           # File and directory handling
  "multcomp"      # Multiple comparisons and post-hoc tests
))

```


## Running the Analysis

Open `Blasco-1-Analysis.Rmd` in **RStudio** and click on "Knit" to generate an HTML report.

The analysis will include:

- Data visualizations
- Statistical results


## Results Summary

- The *blaSCO-1* antimicrobial resistance gene was detected in a wide range of bacterial species and geographic locations,
- The first detection was in the 1980s with a notable increase in reports after 2013. 
- Over 68% of detections were from human clinical isolates, highlighting its clinical significance. 
- *Klebsiella pneumoniae* was the first and most common bacterial species carrying the gene, followed by *E. coli*, *P. aeruginosa*, and *Salmonella enterica*. 
- The results indicate that *blaSCO-1* is more widespread than previously reported and call for expanded One Health surveillance.
